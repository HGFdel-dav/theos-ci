# ReynardDefault

A jailbreak tweak that redirects Safari URL opens to [Reynard](https://github.com/minh-ton/reynard-browser), a Firefox-based browser for iOS.

When enabled, any link that would normally open in Safari is intercepted at the SpringBoard level and opened in Reynard instead.

## 1.5.43 plugin-only native click candidate

This is one native DEB. It contains no WebExtension, XPI, extension profile write or install prompt. SpringBoard Safari-to-Reynard behavior, the settings pane and the Control Centre toggle are unchanged.

Reynard renders pages in its signed `Reynard Helper` process; the tweak therefore installs the same version-guarded native click hook there as well as in the main app. That is an app process, not a browser extension. The hook runs on the XUL `nsDocShell::OnLinkClick` entry and requires a direct click, Activation involvement, user gesture, top-level context, foreground app, no download, and no POST/header stream. Helper only publishes the resulting URL; the active main app consumes the one pending value on the matching notification and asks iOS to open it. If handoff is disabled or the Helper write fails, Gecko's original navigation continues.

The XUL image UUID plus exact instructions for the click entry and the two context getters are checked before patching. Known Telegram `tg:` action spellings receive only the missing `//`; other bytes, including query and fragment, are preserved.

Static host policy and package-source checks pass. iOS compilation, DEB inspection and device acceptance remain separate and are not yet complete.

## Features

- **Safari redirect** — hooks `FBSystemServiceOpenApplicationRequest` in SpringBoard to swap the bundle identifier
- **Reynard click handoff** — native Gecko link-click route; no separate extension required.
- **Settings toggles** — master switch plus one switch per direction, via PreferenceLoader
- **Control Centre toggle** — quick toggle for the Safari redirect via CCSupport module

## Icon

The Settings row icon uses Reynard's app icon from
[minh-ton/reynard-browser](https://github.com/minh-ton/reynard-browser)
(`browser/Reynard/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/icon.png`),
rendered at 29/58/87 px with the rounded mask baked in. The Settings →
Control Center icon (116/174 px) is the upstream artwork and is left alone.
The Control Centre toggle itself uses the fox alone as a plain template
silhouette, so the tile keeps the system look instead of an orange block.

## Requirements

- A jailbroken iOS device — supports **rootless** (Dopamine/Roothide) and **rootful** (unc0ver, palera1n rootful)
- [Reynard](https://github.com/minh-ton/reynard-browser) browser installed
- [CCSupport](https://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=ccsupportDp) (for Control Centre toggle)
- [PreferenceLoader](https://github.com/PoomSmart/PreferenceLoader) (for Settings pane)

## Building

Requires [Theos](https://theos.dev/).

```bash
export THEOS=~/theos
cd ReynardDefault
make rootless   # Dopamine / Roothide
make rootful    # unc0ver / palera1n rootful
make both       # builds both variants side-by-side
```

Builds land in `packages/` as `*_iphoneos-arm64.deb` (rootless) and `*_iphoneos-arm.deb` (rootful). Rootless debs installed via Sileo on Roothide are auto-patched; manual installs need the Roothide Patcher app first.

## Historical upstream environments (not 1.5.34 acceptance)

The following table came from the original Safari-redirect project. It is not evidence that this handoff update has been tested on these devices.

| Device | iOS | Jailbreak | Variant | Status |
|--------|-----|-----------|---------|--------|
| iPhone 14 Pro Max | 16.3.1 | Dopamine (Roothide) | rootless (`iphoneos-arm64`) | Working |
| iPhone 7 | 15.7.7 | Dopamine | rootless (`iphoneos-arm64`) | Working |
| iPhone 7 Plus | 14.8.1 | Taurine 1.1.7-3 | rootful (`iphoneos-arm`) | Working |

Tweak injection via ElleKit (rootless) or substrate (rootful) on arm64 / arm64e.
